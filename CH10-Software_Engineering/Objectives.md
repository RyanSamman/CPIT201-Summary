# Software Engineering - Objectives
## Understand the concept of the software life cycle in software engineering.
The Software Lifecycle is Developing software, for it to be used and modified until it is obsolete

## Development Process's Phases (Extra)
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing

## Describe two major types of development process, the waterfall and incremental models.
### Waterfall
Developing in a phase by phase basis, waiting for each phase to be complete before moving on.

### Incremental
Implement just what you need, or a simplified version of the system. Then, add more functionality as needed.


**Note: (Not relevant for exam anymore)**
Procedural languages such as C.

Object-Oriented Languages such Java.

The main difference is that in Object-Orented Programming, it involves creating abstractions in the forms of classes, methods, and objects. Meanwhile, Procedural Programming is similar to what you have done in CPIT110.

However, most languages support both paradigms, such as Python, C++, Ruby, and more.

## Software Quality
High quality software fulfills the following:
- Meets the stakeholder's requirements
- Meets the Standards of the organization
- Runs Efficiently

High Quality Software also has the following attributes:
- Maintainable through to the future
- Dependable - can be relied on
- Efficient - Slides: 'not be wasteful', but I believe it means 'to be scalable'
- Usability - should meet users' needs

## Documentation
There are three types of `Documentation` which may accompany software:
- User Documentation
- System Documentation
- Technical Documentation
